 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.

   * @dev Moves `amount` of tokens from `sender` to `recipient`.
   *
   * This internal function is equivalent to {transfer}, and can be used to
   * e.g. implement automatic token fees, slashing mechanisms, etc.
   *
   * Emits a {Transfer} event from sender to recipient for actual amount.
   * Emits a {Transfer} event from sender to feeRecipient for friction fee if fee > 0.
   *
   * Requirements:
   *
   * - `sender` cannot be the zero address.
   * - `recipient` cannot be the zero address.
   * - `sender` must have a balance of at least `amount` and `friction fee`.
   * - `amount` can not be zero.
