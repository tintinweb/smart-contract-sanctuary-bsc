     @notice `initiateLiquidationOnTargetChain` has not been implemented yet.

     This function should determine if a particular position is undercollateralized
     by querying the `accountAssets` state variable for the passed account. Calculate
     the health of the account.

     If an account is undercollateralized, this method should generate a Wormhole
     message sent to the target chain by the caller. The caller will invoke the
     `completeRepayOnBehalf` method on the target chain and pass the signed Wormhole
     message as an argument.

     If the account has not yet paid the loan back by the time the Wormhole message
     arrives on the target chain, `completeRepayOnBehalf` will accept funds from the
     caller, and generate another Wormhole messsage to be delivered to the source chain.

     The caller will then invoke `completeLiquidation` on the source chain and pass
     the signed Wormhole message in as an argument. This function should handle
     releasing the account's collateral to the liquidator, less fees (which should be
     defined in the contract and updated by the contract owner).

     In order for off-chain processes to calculate an account's health, the integrator
     needs to expose a getter that will return the list of accounts with open positions.
     The integrator needs to expose a getter that allows the liquidator to query the
