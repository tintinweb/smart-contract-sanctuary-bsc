/** *******************************************************************************
 * @notice Interface for contracts using VRF randomness through the VRF V2 wrapper
 * ********************************************************************************
 * @dev PURPOSE
 *
 * @dev Create VRF V2 requests without the need for subscription management. Rather than creating
 * @dev and funding a VRF V2 subscription, a user can use this wrapper to create one off requests,
 * @dev paying up front rather than at fulfillment.
 *
 * @dev Since the price is determined using the gas price of the request transaction rather than
 * @dev the fulfillment transaction, the wrapper charges an additional premium on callback gas
 * @dev usage, in addition to some extra overhead costs associated with the VRFV2Wrapper contract.
 * *****************************************************************************
 * @dev USAGE
 *
 * @dev Calling contracts must inherit from VRFV2WrapperConsumerBase. The consumer must be funded
 * @dev with enough LINK to make the request, otherwise requests will revert. To request randomness,
 * @dev call the 'requestRandomness' function with the desired VRF parameters. This function handles
 * @dev paying for the request based on the current pricing.
 *
 * @dev Consumers must implement the fullfillRandomWords function, which will be called during
 * @dev fulfillment with the randomness result.
